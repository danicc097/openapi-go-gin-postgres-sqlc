# Package `handlers`

## Instructions

Fill in all `api_*.go` files with your own handler implementations and helper
functions.
For external endpoints not defined in the spec, e.g. fileservers, create a new
handler file that does **not** follow the `api_*.go` pattern.

## Notes

1. Do **not** rename or create new `api_*.go` files, except for `*_test.go`. You
   can safely create any other file that doesn't follow this pattern.
